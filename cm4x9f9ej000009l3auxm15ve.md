Welcome to Day 6 of our Appwrite series. Today we’ll explore implementing user authentication in Appwrite to secure our note-taking app.

### Introduction

User authentication is a crucial aspect of any web application. It ensures that only authorized users can access and modify data. In this article, we’ll implement user authentication in Appwrite

### Implementing User Authentication in Appwrite

To implement user authentication in Appwrite, you can use the Appwrite Console or the Appwrite CLI.

Using the Appring Console

1. Log in to your Appwrite dashboard.
    
2. Navigate to your project.
    
3. Click on the **Authentication** tab in the left sidebar.
    
4. Click on the **Settings** tab.
    
5. Choose an authentication provider (e.g. Email/Password, Google, Facebook, etc.).
    
6. Select **Google** as the provider.
    
7. Enter your Googe Client ID and Client Secret.
    
8. Click the **Update** button.

### Implementing Google Auth in Your App

You’ll need to use the Appwrite Web SDK to implement Google Auth in your app. First, install the SDK using npm:

```bash
npm install appwrite
```

Next, import the SDK in your `auth.ts` file

```typescript
// auth.ts
import { Appwrite } from 'appwrite';

const appwrite = new Appwrite();
appwrite
    .setEndpoint('http://localhost/v1') // Your Appwrite Endpoint
    .setProject('your-project-id') // Your PROJECT ID
```

Endpoint and Project ID can be found on your project **settings** page.

### Authenticating with Google

We’ll need to redirect the user to the Google Auth page to authenticate with Google. We can do this using the `appwrite.auth.redirect` method:

```typescript
// auth.ts
appwrite.auth.redirect('google', 'http://localhost:8080/callback')
    .then(() => {
        console.log('Redirected to Google Auth page');
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

This will redirect the user to the Google Auth page. After the user authenticates, Google will redirect them back to your app.

### Handling the Callback

To handle the callback, you’ll need to create an endpoint that receives the authentication code from Google. You can do this using the `appwrite.auth.callback` method:

```typescript
// callback.ts
appwrite.auth.callback('google', 'http://localhost:8080/callback')
    .then((response) => {
        console.log(response);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);    
    });
```

This will exchange the authentication code for an access token, which you can use to authenticate requests to Appwrite.

### Conclusion

In this article, we implemented user authentication in Appwrite using Google Auth. We set up Google Auth in Appwrite, implemented Google Auth in our app, authenticated with Google, and handled the callback.

Stay tuned for Day 7, where we’ll explore implementing authorization in Appwrite.
